### CQF Projects

1. 7-steps to model building for your selected ticker using Random Forest Classifier. [Private Repo](https://github.com/amit-tembhurnikar/trend_RCF)

| Steps| Workflow | Remarks|
|:---------|:-----------------|:-------------------|
|Step 1| Ideation | Predict positive up moves (Up trends) above 0.25% (transaction cost)|
|Step 2| Data collection | Download data from Yahoo Finance, store on local drive|
|Step 3| Exploration Data analysis | Study Summary statistics|
|Step 4| Cleaning Dataset | Check for any null values|
|Step 5| Transformation | Perform feature scaling based on EDA|
|Step 6| Modeling | Building and training Random Forest Classifier|
|Step 7| Metrics | Validating the model performance using the score method|


Feature selection
   
| Features| Formula | Description|
|:---------------|:-----------------:|:-------------------| 
|O-C, H-L| Open - Close, High - Low | intraday price range|
|Sign| $sign (rt = ln \frac{P_t}{P_{t-1}})$ | sign of return|
|Past Return| $r_{t-1}, r_{t-2}$ | lagged returns|
|Moving Average| $ SMA_i = \frac{1}{n}\Sigma^{n-1}_{i=0} P_{t-i} $ | simple moving average|
|Momentum| $P_{t} - P_{t-k}$ | price change over k period|


#### Observations
- Test accuracy improved by 4% as compared to the earlier model, also we can see the overfitting decreased significantly.
- Model improved predictor for upside, as we can see the increase in true positive when compared to the downside.


#### Back-testing
We then compare the result of this strategy with the buy and hold and visualize the performance of the RandomForestClassifier Algorithm.

#### Observations of back-test:
- The CAGR return for the out-sample is 23.6%, on the higher side compared to the in-sample.
- The absolute monthly return by this strategy is negative just for 1 month, while there is also a positive return for absolute annual returns.



2. Monte Carlo Simulation for Pricing Asian Options and Lookback Options.
